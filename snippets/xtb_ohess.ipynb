Using this code we were able to optimize 12796 molecules for a project in progress aimed to develop a geometry-aware graph neural network to predict toxicity."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ExkAx-4C48T6"},"outputs":[],"source":["# I ran this locally on a desktop computer, RDKit and xtb should be previously installed.\n","\n","# The following Python libraries and modules are required\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","from rdkit import Chem\n","from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n","from rdkit.Chem.rdmolfiles import MolToXYZBlock\n","\n","# Load Excel file containing SMILES and CIDs\n","df = pd.read_excel(\"smiles_excel.xlsx\")\n","\n","# Select a range of rows (e.g., from row 0 to 8 for 9 molecules)\n","df = df.iloc[:]  # Adjust the range as needed\n","\n","# Base directory for output\n","base_output_dir = \"xtb_ohess\"\n","os.makedirs(base_output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","# Function to process each SMILES string with its corresponding CID\n","def process_smiles(smiles, cid):\n","    try:\n","        # Create molecule directory using CID, formatted as an integer\n","        mol_dir = os.path.join(base_output_dir, f\"CID_{int(cid)}\")\n","        os.makedirs(mol_dir, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","        # Define filenames within molecule directory\n","        xyz_filename = os.path.join(mol_dir, \"structure.xyz\")\n","        out_filename = os.path.join(mol_dir, \"output.out\")\n","\n","        # Check if the XYZ file already exists to avoid overwriting\n","        if os.path.exists(xyz_filename):\n","            print(f\"Skipping XYZ file creation for CID_{int(cid)} as it already exists.\")\n","            return # Skip further processing for this molecule\n","\n","        # Generate RDKit molecule object\n","        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n","        mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)  # Add explicit hydrogens\n","\n","        # Generate 3D coordinates\n","        if AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol, AllChem.ETKDG()) != 0:\n","            raise ValueError(f\"RDKit failed to generate 3D coordinates for {smiles}\")\n","\n","        # Optimize geometry using UFF (Universal Force Field)\n","        AllChem.UFFOptimizeMolecule(mol)\n","\n","        # Convert to XYZ format\n","        xyz_content = MolToXYZBlock(mol)\n","\n","        # Save XYZ file\n","        with open(xyz_filename, \"w\") as f:\n","            f.write(xyz_content)\n","\n","        print(f\"XYZ file created: {xyz_filename}\")\n","\n","        # Run XTB optimization inside the molecule directory\n","        os.system(f\"cd {mol_dir} && xtb structure.xyz --ohess > optimization.out\")\n","\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Error processing SMILES {smiles} (CID: {cid}): {e}\")\n","\n","# Apply function to selected SMILES/CIDs (Excel file contains columns called \"SMILES\" and \"CID\")\n","for _, row in df.iterrows():\n","    smiles = row[\"SMILES\"]\n","    cid = row[\"CID\"]\n","    process_smiles(smiles, cid)\n","\n","print(\"\\nGeometry optimization of this batch is done.\")"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"base","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.19"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
